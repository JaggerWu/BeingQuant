# Learning Algorithmic Trading

I am working as a graduate quant developer for a investment bank in Denmark. Since I have strong background in Mathematic and Computer Science Theory, but I do not have any courses in finance. The respo is recording the learning process about how to be pursue a job in quant career.

## Data Mining

### PCA
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. 

### Machine Learning
[Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) isMl  the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.
