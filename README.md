# Learning Algorithmic Trading

I am working as a graduate quant developer for a investment bank in Denmark. I have strong background in Mathematic and Computer Science Theory, but I did not have any courses in computational finance. The respo is to record the learning process about how to be pursue a job in quant career.

## Data Mining

### PCA
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. 

### Machine Learning
[Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. 

## Wavelet

### Fourier
[Fourier Analysis](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~djmorin/waves/Fourier.pdf) is the study of the way general functions may be represented or approximated by sums of simpler trigonometric functions. 

### Wavelet
A [Wavelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet) is a wave-like oscillation with an amplitude that begins at zero, increases, and then decreases back to zero. It can typically be visualized as a "brief oscillation" like one recorded by a seismograph or heart monitor. Generally, wavelets are intentionally crafted to have specific properties that make them useful for signal processing. Using a "reverse, shift, multiply and integrate" technique called convolution, wavelets can be combined with known portions of a damaged signal to extract information from the unknown portions.
